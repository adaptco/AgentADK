# Codespace Selection for the Active Repository Context

The relevant browser tab is:

- **Merge · Issue #5 · Q-Enterprises/.github** (`tabId: 2049280404`)

From that context, the active repository is:

- **`Q-Enterprises/.github`**

## Correct codespace to use

Use a codespace for **`Q-Enterprises/.github`**.

## Why this is correct

- Codespaces are created per repository, not per organization.
- Your active issue context is in `Q-Enterprises/.github`.
- The landing page lists templates/options, but repository context determines the right codespace.
- To guarantee the correct target, start creation from the repository page.

## How to open it

1. Go to `https://github.com/Q-Enterprises/.github`.
2. Click **Code**.
3. Open the **Codespaces** tab.
4. Click **Create codespace on main**.

If you later switch to work in another repository (for example, a physics-drift pipeline repo), create and use a codespace for that specific repository instead.
